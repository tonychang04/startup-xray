      - Bold key terms or phrases
      - You MUST include the CRITICAL data points in the EXACT format requested
      - If you cannot find the exact information for a CRITICAL data point, make a reasonable estimate and clearly indicate it's an estimate
      - Do not include any additional text between the heading and bullet points
      - Remember: It's better to provide an estimate with a disclaimer than to omit CRITICAL data points`;
